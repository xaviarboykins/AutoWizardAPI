# AutoWizardAPI Documentation

## Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for AutoWizardAPI, an open-source API that provides car diagnostic services. This API allows developers to retrieve Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTC) and access related information for various car makes and models. With AutoWizardAPI, you can incorporate car diagnostic capabilities into your applications without the need for an API key.

## Purpose

The purpose of AutoWizardAPI is to provide developers with a flexible and transparent solution for accessing car diagnostic information. The API is designed to be easily accessible and customizable, enabling developers to build intelligent diagnostic applications, vehicle monitoring systems, or any other software solution that requires car diagnostic capabilities.

## Key Features

- Retrieve Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTC) for vehicles.
- Access detailed descriptions and possible causes for specific DTC codes.
- Get recommended solutions for addressing specific DTC codes.
- Perform searches for DTC codes based on various criteria.
- Easy integration with your applications and services.

## Getting Started

To get started with AutoWizardAPI, follow these steps:

To get started with the AutoWizardAPI, simply clone or download the API source code from the official repository on GitHub. The source code is openly available, allowing you to explore, modify, and adapt the API to suit your specific needs. The repository also contains documentation, examples, and resources to help you understand and utilize the API effectively.

Please refer to the sections below for detailed information on the API endpoints, request/response formats, and error handling.

1. Clone or download the API source code from the official repository on GitHub.
2. Install the required NuGet packages, including `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`, `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore`, `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer`, `Swashbuckle.AspNetCore`, and `Newtonsoft.Json`.
3. Make sure you have the necessary software installed, including the Microsoft .NET SDK, Visual Studio (or Visual Studio Code), and SQL Server if you plan to use it as the database.
4. Set up your development environment and configure the API according to your requirements.
5. Explore the API endpoints, request/response formats, and error handling to understand how to interact with AutoWizardAPI effectively.

### Version History

Let's leverage the power of car diagnostics together with the open-source AutoWizardAPI!


## AutoWizardAPI Endpoints

The DTCCode API allows you to retrieve Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTC) for vehicles. You can get a list of all available DTC codes or retrieve details for a specific DTC code.

### Get All DTC Codes

Retrieve a list of all available DTC codes.

**Request**

- Method: `GET`
- URL: `/api/DTCCode`

**Response**

- Status Code: `200 OK`
- Body:
  ```json
  [
    {
      "code": "P0010",
      "description": "A Camshaft Position Actuator Circuit (Bank 1)",
      "possibleCauses": "1. Faulty camshaft position actuator\n2. Camshaft position actuator harness is open or shorted\n3. Camshaft position actuator circuit poor electrical connection\n4. Faulty Engine Control Module (ECM)",
      "solutions": "1. Replace the camshaft position actuator\n2. Repair or replace the camshaft position actuator harness\n3. Check the electrical connections for any loose or damaged wires\n4. Replace the Engine Control Module (ECM)"
    },
    {
      "code": "P0300",
      "description": "Random/Multiple Cylinder Misfire Detected",
      "possibleCauses": "1. Faulty spark plugs or ignition coils\n2. Fuel delivery issues\n3. Engine mechanical problems\n4. Faulty sensors (e.g., crankshaft position sensor, camshaft position sensor)",
      "solutions": "1. Inspect and replace spark plugs or ignition coils as necessary\n2. Check fuel pressure and fuel injectors\n3. Perform a compression test and inspect engine components\n4. Test and replace faulty sensors"
    },
    ...
  ]
  ```

### Get DTC Code by Code

Retrieve details for a specific DTC code.

**Request**

- Method: `GET`
- URL: `/api/DTCCode/{code}`

  - Replace `{code}` with the actual DTC code you want to retrieve, e.g., `/api/DTCCode/P0010`

**Response**

- Status Code: `200 OK`
- Body:
  ```json
  {
    "code": "P0010",
    "description": "A Camshaft Position Actuator Circuit (Bank 1)",
    "possibleCauses": "1. Faulty camshaft position actuator\n2. Camshaft position actuator harness is open or shorted\n3. Camshaft position actuator circuit poor electrical connection\n4. Faulty Engine Control Module (ECM)",
    "solutions": "1. Replace the camshaft position actuator\n2. Repair or replace the camshaft position actuator harness\n3. Check the electrical connections for any loose or damaged wires\n4. Replace the Engine Control Module (ECM)"
  }
  ```

**Possible HTTP Status Codes**

- `200 OK`: The request was successful, and the response body contains the requested DTC code information.
- `404 Not Found`: The requested DTC code does not exist or could not be found.
- `500 Internal Server Error`: An unexpected error occurred while processing the request. The response body may contain additional error details.
